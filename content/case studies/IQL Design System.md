- Why did you need a design system?
    
    - Inconsistencies across modules (e.g. EMR, Lab, IPD, etc.)
        
    - Developer handoffs taking time
        
    - Difficulty in applying branding for different clients
        
- State the **goals** of the system
    
    - Consistency
        
    - Theming for different organizations
        
    - Developer efficiency
        
    - Accessibility & Scalability

### 3. **Team & Collaboration**

- Your role and key responsibilities
    
- Who else was involved?
    
    - Devs, QA, PMs
        
- How did you collaborate?
    
    - Weekly syncs, design tokens discussions, Git workflows
        

---

### 4. **Foundation**

- **Research / Audits**
    
    - UI inventory across products
        
    - Identifying patterns & inconsistencies
        
- **Decisions**
    
    - Chose px over rem for legacy reasons
        
    - Token groups: Base, Semantic, Theme, Responsive
        
    - Token syncing via Figma plugin ‚Üí GitHub ‚Üí CI/CD
        

---

### 5. **Design Token Strategy**

- Token structure:
    
    |Group|Purpose|Examples|
    |---|---|---|
    |Base|Raw values|`#000000`, `14px`, `24px`|
    |Semantic|Meaningful use|`text.primary`, `bg.surface`|
    |Theme|Brand-specific overrides|`primary.main`, `accent.alt`|
    |Responsive|Breakpoint-specific tokens|`fontSize.sm`, `padding.md`|
    
- How you handled:
    
    - **Light/Dark modes**
        
    - **Multi-brand theming**
        
    - **Tailwind conversion**
        

---

### 6. **Component Library**

- Built using React + Tailwind (or Chakra UI?)
    
- List key components:
    
    - Button, Input, Modal, Toast, Badge, etc.
        
- States and variants (primary, secondary, disabled, loading)
    
- How tokens power these components
    
- Developer documentation + Storybook (if used)
    

---

### 7. **CI/CD & Dev Integration**

- Setup for:
    
    - Figma ‚Üí Tokens Plugin ‚Üí GitHub ‚Üí Style Dictionary ‚Üí NPM Package
        
- Challenges and learnings from GitHub PAT permissions, file structure, etc.
    
- Platform-based output: Web, Mobile, Tailwind, etc.
    

---

### 8. **Adoption & Impact**

- Metrics (if available):
    
    - No. of products using it
        
    - Speed of dev implementation
        
    - Consistency improvement
        
- Testimonials from devs or PMs
    
- Before & After Screenshots
    

---

### 9. **Challenges & Learnings**

- Token management edge cases
    
- Collaborating across multiple product teams
    
- Keeping it modular and scalable
    
- Dealing with legacy CSS overrides
    

---

### 10. **What‚Äôs Next / Roadmap**

- Token Studio ‚Üí Figma Variables migration?
    
- Theming Admin Panel for organizations
    
- Accessibility Audits
    
- Cross-platform tokens (Flutter, React Native?)
    

---

### 11. **Final Reflection**

- Personal growth as a system thinker
    
- How this project sharpened your collaboration and scalability skills
    
- Your design philosophy that guided this work

## üí° Bonus Tips for Portfolio:

- Include interactive snippets (if it's on a site)
    
- Use side-by-side before-after comparisons
    
- Add mini-gifs showing tokens being applied
    
- Keep it scannable and visually clean
    
- End with a CTA like ‚ÄúReach out if you want to talk design systems!‚Äù
